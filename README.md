# georefum
This is an R package. Currently, it is under heavy, heavy development. So please do not expect a finished product. Especially the 
documentation is lacking relevant information. But it is planned to deliver a stable version by February 2017. So stay tuned!

## Installation
Install the 'georefum' package from GitHub:

~~~{r}
devtools::install_github("stefmue/georefum")
~~~

This may take a while as the package contains large data. Therefore, it is not in compliance with CRAN.
